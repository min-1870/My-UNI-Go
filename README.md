# my_uni_go

Introducing "my UNI go", a comprehensive platform that allows university students to access services all around their university's homepages. This platform consolidates all of the scattered functions into one application, making it easier for students to access essential services such as transportation information, Special Consideration applications, and nucleus appointments. The platform is open-sourced, meaning the source code is available to the public, allowing developers to suggest improvements, fix problems, and add new features. This open-source project is collaborative, contributing to the solution's longevity and continuity with minimized cost, making it a sustainable solution for university students. "my UNI go" is tailored to individual needs and wants upon request, much like a bespoke solution, and is available to all university students, regardless of their institution.

The goal of this project is to integrate various school systems into a single platform, which will be available as a mobile application. We collected advice from industry professionals and the opinions of students to build the ideal platform for university students, including features like digital ID and the Google Maps API. We developed the application using Flutter, making it universally applicable.
